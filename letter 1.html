            <p class="greeting">Hey Mimmah,</p>
            <p>Just wanted to drop you a message to remind you how much you mean to me. Even in the busiest moments or when we're not together, you're always on my mind. I can’t help but think about all the little things that make us us—the way you laugh, the way you make everything feel a little brighter, and how just hearing your voice can turn any day around.</p>
            <p>I’m so grateful to have you in my life. Whether we’re doing something exciting or just chilling, every moment with you feels special. I love how we can talk about anything, or even just enjoy the silence together. It's those little things that make me appreciate you even more.</p>
            <p>No matter what’s going on around us, I’m always here for you. And I know we’ve got so many more great memories ahead of us. Just wanted you to know that you’re amazing, and I’m lucky to call you mine.</p>
            <p class="closing">Talk soon, or whenever you need a little reminder that I’m thinking of you.</p>
