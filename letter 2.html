        <div class="letter">
I’ve been thinking a lot lately about just how blessed I am to have you in my life. There are so many things I admire about you, and I wanted to take a moment to tell you how much they mean to me.

One of the things I love most about you is your faith. The way you live your life with such sincerity and devotion is truly inspiring. Your piety isn’t just something you practice—it’s a part of who you are, and it’s one of the things that makes you so special. I see how it guides your decisions and the kindness you show to others, and it’s just one of the many reasons I love and respect you so much.

And then there’s the way you care for me. It’s something I never take for granted. You’re always looking out for me, making sure I’m okay, and showing your love in so many thoughtful ways. It’s those little things—like the way you remember what I like, or how you check in just when I need it—that remind me how lucky I am to have you by my side.

You have such a beautiful heart. The way you balance everything, taking care of yourself, your faith, and the people you love, is something I deeply admire. It makes me want to be a better person, just by being around you.

Thank you for being you. For your love, your care, and your unwavering goodness. I’m so grateful for every moment we share, and I can’t wait to see where life takes us together.
